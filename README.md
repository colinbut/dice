This is a dice playing game. There are two players in the game where the players throws the dice on their turns.
The players are "Joe" and "Jane".

When one player throws the dice, the other player waits. Once the player completes his/her turn, he/she informs it is
the other player's turn to throw the dice. After that, he/she starts waiting for the other player to complete their turn.

The game ends when each player has thrown the dice a number of times (lets say 6). So after 6 turns there would be 
a total of 12 throws of the dice.
